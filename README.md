# Projectile_Trajectory_Calculator
This is a calculator for calculating and drawing the projectile trajectory, given the height, the angle and the speed of a trajectory. (Made for a Coding Camp)


# Console App with Python
This is a simple console application written using python and OOP concepts. The inputs are very simple: the height, the angle in degrees and the speed of the trajectory in m/s

# Trajectory Displacement Calculation
The caculation depends on this projectile formula:

# Program's Output
The output should be something like this, drawing an imaginary path of the projectile

# Running the program
It's a simple one-file code. Using any python interpreter and a console, the program can easily run without any pre-installations
